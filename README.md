fractal channeling approach

Actors of the system:
1. Refugee
2. Goods transport
3. People transport
4. resource gathering point
5. people gathering point
6. resource providers
7. shelter providers
8. shelter finders

Green flow (how we want this to happen):
1. Goods transports are organised:
- (4) Resource gathering point signals what they have
- (5) People gathering point request resources
- (2) Car drivers can check from where to where deliver goods
2. People gathering point are well supplied
- (1,5) Refugee signalizes their local People gathering point
- (1) Refugee signalizes their needs (number and age of people + any special needs like medications)
- (5) People gathering point updates needed materials and quotas
- (4) Goods providers check on the app which goods are neded and give them to the resource gathering point
- Flow 1
3. Goods reach distributed shelters:
- (1, 5, 6) after reaching distributed shelters Refugee signalise their location, and pin their nearest People gathering point
- (1) Refugee in distributed shelters signalizes their needs
- (5,1) People gathering point updates needed materials and quotas but taggs it with Refugee destination adress
- (5)while packaging the delivery for distributed shelters add a stapled note with the name and adress (in case of medical supply it is crucial not to mix it), 
5. Refugee travel safely to shelter
- (8/7)shelter finders are checking the advertisment and reaching out to potential shelter providers (or shelter providers appear on their own)
- (8/7)shelter gets added to the list with gps localization and number of rooms and beds
- (1) Refugee check on the application where are free shelter spaces 
- (1,3,7) They check if they can move to destination (if there is a free transport) and signal the providers
- (1,5) If they cannot get to the destination they stay in the local shelter station that has the necesary supplies (because of 1 and 2)
- (1,2) As they reach the destination there is recurring transportation of goods (because of 3)
